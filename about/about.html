                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>I am a <strong><span class="highlight">4th year Computer Engineering major</span></strong>, focusing more on software, rather than hardware. I was originally admitted to <abbr title="University of California San Diego">UCSD</abbr> as an Aerospace Engineering Major, but figured out at the end of my first year that I enjoyed programming much more than Aerospace Engineering. In particular, I enjoyed the iterative problem solving style of programming, as opposed to the more waterfall style used in Aerospace Engineering. The <dfn>waterfall approach</dfn> plans and accounts for everthing ahead of time before beginning programming and does not produce an <dfn>MVP</dfn>, which stands for Minimal Viable Product, until the product is completely finished. I plan to become a software engineer in the future and my immediate plans include getting a masters in Data Science and Machine Learning with ECE department's BS/MS program. <del>I chose to get my masters in Data Science and Machine Learning as data science has always been important so I'd have that to fallback onto if machine learning doesn't work out.</del> <ins>I chose to get my masters in Data Science and Machine Learning as I enjoy learning about both and see machine learning becoming a key part of software engineering in the future.</ins></p>
